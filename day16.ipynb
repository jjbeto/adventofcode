    "As you're walking to yet another connecting flight, you realize that one of the legs of your re-routed trip coming up is on a high-speed train. However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, you can't actually **read** the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out **the fields these tickets must have** and **the valid ranges** for values in those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "You collect the **rules for ticket fields**, the **numbers on your ticket**, and the **numbers on other nearby tickets** for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **rules for ticket fields** specify a list of fields that exist **somewhere** on the ticket and the **valid ranges of values** for each field. For example, a rule like `class: 1-3 or 5-7` means that one of the fields in every ticket is named `class` and can be any value in the ranges `1-3 or 5-7` (inclusive, such that `3` and `5` are both valid in this field, but `4` is not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".--------------------------------------------------------.\n",
    "| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |\n",
    "|                                                        |\n",
    "| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |\n",
    "| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |\n",
    "'--------------------------------------------------------'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `?` represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as `101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403`; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are much **more** complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by determining which tickets are **completely invalid**; these are tickets that contain values which **aren't valid for any field**. Ignore **your ticket** for now.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class: 1-3 or 5-7\n",

    "38,6,12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid **nearby tickets** by considering only whether tickets contain **values that are not valid for any field**. In this example, the values on the first **nearby ticket** are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three **nearby tickets**: the values `4`, `55`, and `12` are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your **ticket scanning error rate: 4 + 55 + 12 = 71**.\n",
